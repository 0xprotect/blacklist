## Blacklist

This repo consists of a simple smart contract with a list of blacklisted addresses on Ethereum that is maintained as a public good for the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Currently, the only blacklisted addresses come from the OFAC SDN list, which is monitored hourly for updates.  When an address is added or removed from this list, the changes will be reflected in this smart contract.
